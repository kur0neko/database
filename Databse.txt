Constraints on Relationship Type
one to one (1:1) --> a business might decide to assign one office 
One to many (1:N) or many to  one (N:1) (each customer can have many sales)
Many to Many (M:N) (many customers can have many orders, or many customers can have many invoices)

Relationship of Higher Degree
-Relationship types of degree 2 are called binary
-Relationship types of degree 3 are called ternary and of degree n are called n-ary
-In general, an n-ary relationship is not equivalent to n binary relationships

Same type of relationship can represented in Multiples way. 

Constraints are harder to specify for higher-
degree relationships (n > 2) than for binary
relationships.

There are 4 types of degrees of relationship based on the involved entities

    Unary relationship- also called recursive, is one in which a relationship exists between occurrences of the same entity set.
    Binary relationship-In a Binary relationship, there are two types of entity associates
. So, we can say that a Binary relationship exists when there are two types of entity and we call them a degree of relationship is 2.
 Or in other words, in a relation when two entity sets are participating then such type of relationship is known as a binary relationship.
 This is the most used relationship and one can easily be converted into a relational.
